Questions 

1.     What other possible scenarios would you suggest for testing the Jupiter Toys application?

路      Validate the home page and home page title or URL link verify

路      From moving from one page to another page validate each page test

 

2.     Jupiter Toys is expected to grow and expand its offering into books, tech, and modern art. We are expecting the tests will grow to a very large number.

路      BDD approach to reduce the overall excitation time

路      End to ed testing , integration testing and Unit testing

 

 

3.     Describe when to use a BDD approach to automation and when NOT to use BDD

In my opinion, BDD should be used for verifying the most important parts of the application using end-to-end tests. That probably includes starting the application and testing it with Selenium or similar. BDD should also be used to verify the wanted behavior using integration tests. Importantly, the business should be able to understand these tests, so you can reduce uncertainty and build confidence in what you are building. Sometimes it is valuable to implement BDD with Cucumber for unit tests, but only when the business can benefit. Imagine a specific algorithm that decides to sell a stock for instance.
